The distribution contains the full net-beans project  including distribution  compiled jar file and  javamail.jar 
file for using the java mail api 

You need to alter the properties file which is the  source folder and  and where the **** are fill out all 
relevant details pertaining to your email provider 

You can either do this by unzipping the jar file and  and then saving your 
alterations directly or by altering the  mail,properties file  which is contained in the source folder

contains two subheadings for list.recip1 , list.recip2 You can add to this list and create more entries for persons 
whom you want to receive your emails  or you can add this into the code yourself 

You can also alter the message but this would mean recompiling 
I'm working on this at present  with a full gui so that you can change the message 

If you want to add photos then you can 
You must save one copy to the main project folder and one copy to the distribution folder 

Dont ask me why  you have to do this but for some  reason  after compiling in net beans and running the compiled jarfile 
this is  works however the path of the attached file is different to that seen by the  distribution  path 

Im currently working on other aspects but due to having to move my time is occupied extensively at present
